# uber_data_analysis
A machine learning project which predicts Uber price for different factors.
Objective:
The objective is to first explore hidden or previously unknown information by applying exploratory data analytics on the dataset and to know the effect of each field on price with every other field of the dataset. Then we apply different machine learning models to complete the analysis. After this, the results of applied machine learning models were compared and analyzed on the basis of accuracy, and then the best performing model was suggested for further predictions of the label ‘Price’.
DataSet:
For this project we are taken the dataset from kaggle
Application of this Project:
We use machine learning algorithms to predict the price of Uber, so that it is easy for the company to do analysis on price based on certain features.
